# AI-Powered Micro-Service Log Analytics for Proactive System Insights

## Overview

This project aims to pioneer in the field of AI-powered log analytics, focusing on anomaly detection in microservice architectures. Developed by Karthikeyan Velusamy, Muthamil Selvan Gowthaman, Vishwajit Bhosale, and Abhinav Kumar for the Capstone project at California State University, East Bay, in December 2023, it represents a significant stride in monitoring and maintaining the health of distributed microservice systems.

## Project Description

The project explores the application of deep learning techniques, inspired by the principles of DeepTraLog, to create a unified, graph-based representation of microservice behaviors. This method enhances the ability to detect anomalies in real-time, providing a more comprehensive and accurate approach than traditional models.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Efficient capture of live data streams from microservices.
- **Robust Processing Engine:** Transforms raw data into analysis-ready formats.
- **Advanced Alerting Mechanism:** Timely alerts for system administrators upon anomaly detection.
- **Comparative Model Analysis:** Evaluation of RandomForestClassifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and XGBoost for optimal performance.

### Case Study: Train Ticket Application

Our project employs a train ticketing application with 41 microservices as a testbed, offering insights into user interactions, transaction flows, and system behaviors.

### Tools Used

- **Elasticsearch:** For data storage and analysis.
- **Fluentd:** As a data collector for logging layers.
- **Apache SkyWalking:** For collecting trace data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** RandomForestClassifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and XGBoost.

## Installation & Usage

[Instructions for setting up the project, including environment setup, dependencies, and running the application.]

## Results & Conclusion

Our findings indicate that the RandomForestClassifier exhibits superior capabilities in detecting anomalies within microservices, balancing precision and recall effectively.

## Future Work

We plan to further refine our models and explore the integration of our system into larger-scale microservice environments.
